## 🌳 Branches

### `main`
The `main` branch contains the stable version of all playbooks. This is the branch that you should use for production environments.

### `development`
The `development` branch is used for testing and developing new playbooks. This branch may contain unstable or experimental features. Contributions and new features are first merged into this branch before being pushed to `main`.

### `staging`
The `staging` branch is a pre-production environment where playbooks from the `development` branch are tested before being merged into `main`. This branch is intended to mimic the production environment as closely as possible.

### `feature/<feature-name>`
Feature branches are created for developing new features or playbooks. Once a feature is complete, it will be merged into the `development` branch.

### `hotfix/<hotfix-name>`
Hotfix branches are created for urgent fixes in the `main` branch. These changes are directly merged into `main` and then backported to other branches if necessary.

## 🚀 Getting Started
